This code exists to create a function (fit-function-to-points points)
  where (points) is a list of lists,
    each member list containing two numbers: an x-coordinate and a y-coordinate.

It returns a function that maps an input value to an output value,
  such that all the inputs specified yield the outputs specified.

Note that because the points describe a function, the same x-coordinate cannot appear twice in the list.
  The function does not check for this error condition;
    inputting the same x-coordinate twice will cause an error or infinite loop.

To implement this polynomial to fit the points, the function uses matrix algebra.
